# Relationships Between School Performance and Funding Analysis, Revised

## Project Overview and Purpose

Analysis of standardized tests data can provide insights to academic performance trends and patterns that can be used to make decisions. A previous analysis looked at the relationships of school type, school size and school funding to academic success, which can be measured in a variety of ways, incuding:

•	Average math scores

•	Average reading scores

•	Percentage passing math (score >= 70)

•	Percentage passing reading (score >= 70)

•	Percentage passing both math and reading (scores >= 70)

The previous analysis was compromised due to academic dishonesty in reporting the reading and math grades for Thomas HIgh School ninth graders.  THe purpose of this current project is to remove these compromise scores (by replacing the scores with NaNs) and repeat the analysis on the remaining intact data.  The resulting report will review the resulting changes.
